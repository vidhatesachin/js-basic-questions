What is the value of clothes[0]:

const clothes = ['jacket', 't-shirt'];
clothes.length = 0;

console.log(clothes[0]);  => ?????

Answer: 
length property of the array object has a special behavior:

Reducing the value of the length property has the side-effect of deleting own array elements whose array index is between the old and new length values.

As result when JavaScript executes clothes.length = 0, all clothes items are deleted.

clothes[0] is undefined, because clothes array has been emptied.
